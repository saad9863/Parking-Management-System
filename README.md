# Parking-Management-System

Overview
This project is a Parking Lot Management System implemented on a PIC18F4550 microcontroller. The system uses a PIC18F4550 microcontroller to control and manage a parking lot. It includes features like entering a parking spot, displaying occupancy information on an LCD screen, and storing data in EEPROM memory.

Features
•	Keypad Input: Users can input parking spot addresses using a 3x3 matrix keypad.

•	LCD Display: The system displays information on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). It shows whether a parking spot is occupied or vacant.

•	EEPROM Storage: Parking spot data, including occupancy status, is stored in the microcontroller's EEPROM memory.

•	Occupancy Calculation: The system calculates and displays the number of occupied and vacant parking spots.


Hardware Requirements

•	PIC18F4550 microcontroller
•	3x3 matrix keypad
•	LCD Display
•	EEPROM
